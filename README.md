# D365Agent
Azure DevOps Build &amp; Test agent for Dynamics 365 CE

The goal was to create a build server that could be used to build and test things developed for Dynamics 365 CE. So that means being able to build and test .NET based plug-ins / workflows, JavaScript / TypeScript, run EasyRepro / Selenium UI tests, and be able to deploy as needed.
